/* Shizhen speaks:
 * “Its 
leaves are flat, narrow at the base, broad and lobed at the end. 
The young leaves can be eaten. Deer are fond of the plant. 
In autumn it bears small, yellow flowers. The fruit is as large 
as that of the /laxtago major, and contains minute seeds, 
hardly distinguishable; wherefore the ancients asserted that 
the plant had no seeds, and called it the male southernwood.”’”

 * This file, `eoreader7/native/organs/kind-standing.js`, implements a hierarchical classification of medicinal plants as outlined by Li Shizhen's `Bencao Gangmu`.  While the  manual labor of this approach is a valuable tool for organizing and understanding the vast diversity of medicinal plants, the process must remain grounded in the principles of empirical observation and the inherent uncertainties of the human condition.

// kind-standing.js — what KIND of thing is this referent? Measured from the
// Handle: Shizhen — after Li Shizhen's Bencao Gangmu: one individual specimen placed into a ranked, classified kind. Amendment XVII.
// material's own company, never taught, and gated by a null that is licensed
// for the question actually being asked.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Three cast defects found reading Dracula live all reduce
// to one absence: the reader could not tell what kind of thing a referent
// was, so `Castle Dracula` folded into `Count Dracula` on a shared final
// token. A fold gate needs a STANDING to consult, and nothing produced one.
//
// FEATURES: NOTHING NAMED, NOTHING TAUGHT. The only evidence is the token
// immediately before and immediately after each mention — Firth's company,
// which P31 already cites. No part of speech, no semantic label, no word
// list. Sentence start is its own token, so position is evidence too.
//
// COUNTS, NOT SETS. A presence/absence profile destroys the signal: "Van
// Helsing" genuinely has `before=to` (14x), swamped by `^`(78) and `dr`(63).
// Membership cannot express "mostly prepositions" vs "mostly subject
// position"; a count vector can. Measured: a PMI gate over presence sets was
// tried at three thresholds and did not separate anything.
//
// ── THE NULL, AND TWO THAT WERE REFUTED BEFORE THIS ONE ──────────────────
//
// A10: before spending a null, check the pair is licensed — a statistic
// insensitive to its perturbation fails invisibly. Three were measured here,
// and only the third answers the membership question:
//
//  (1) RANDOM SUBSETS OF THE SAME POPULATION (the engine's own basin null,
//      entity-kind-induction.js). Degenerate when the basin approaches the
//      population: a random 149-subset of 174 entities is nearly the observed
//      set, so it passed a "kind" containing 85% of everything. It concealed
//      a real kind, not merely a false one.
//
//  (2) REDEALING WHICH ENTITY EACH MENTION BELONGS TO. Sound for asking
//      whether STRUCTURE EXISTS at all — observed binding energy 0.2657
//      against a 200-draw maximum of 0.2009, censored above. But insensitive
//      to MEMBERSHIP: adding one outsider to a cohesive ten-member set barely
//      moves binding energy, so every candidate "passed", including Mina and
//      Van Helsing against a set of places. Right question, wrong grain.
//      It also runs BACKWARDS for raw similarity — redealing gives every
//      entity the corpus-average profile, so redealt entities are MORE alike
//      than real ones (null median 0.400, max 0.950). Real entities are
//      specialised, therefore less similar. Agglomerating on "observed
//      similarity beats the null" stalls at all-singletons for that reason.
//
//  (3) THE POPULATION ITSELF (what ships). Nothing is redealt. The question
//      "is X a member of kind K" is answered by asking whether X sits closer
//      to K's members than the rest of the material does. The comparison is
//      every other entity, measured, not simulated.
//
// VALIDATED BY ITS OWN CONTROLS, not asserted: 9 of 10 declared members of a
// place-kind recover as members; the tenth (Purfleet, p≈0.10) is genuinely
// marginal and is reported as such rather than rounded in. `Castle Dracula`
// reads MEMBER (rank 3/100); `Count Dracula` reads not-a-member (43/100);
// Van Helsing, Mina, Lucy and Renfield all correctly not-places.
//
// DISCLOSED, NOT SILENTLY ABSENT. A referent with few mentions has a thin
// profile and lands not-a-member for lack of evidence rather than for
// evidence of difference — `East Cliff` (61/100) is exactly that case, which
// is why the East/West Cliff conflation is NOT closed by this. A verdict of
// `unknown` below is that state, and a gate must treat it as "no standing",
// never as "different kind".
//
// PURE. Sentences and surfaces arrive as arguments; this module reads no
// engine of its own (the cast.js posture).

// should be a discovered kind, and that kind can be addressable, and we can

//
// Measured on the real War and Peace HEARD stream (case- and diacritic-
// folded — the ear has no case) before this was built: general/count/
// emperor/colonel/captain all announce `before=the` as their dominant
// company (17–46% of it); kutuzov/napoleon/pierre/rostov/denisov all
// announce `before=^` with determiners absent; kutuzov~napoleon cosine
// 0.949 vs general~kutuzov 0.214. The kinds are real and the signature IS
// the name: `kind:before=the`, `kind:before=^`. One candidate signal was
// measured and REFUSED the same hour: cross-kind precedence ("titles front
// many different names") reads 0.6% at any practical sample of the name
// kind, because a title fronts hundreds of names — do not retry it as a
// gate.
//
// The structural distinction a consumer may lean on WITHOUT a word list: a
// kind signed by a WORD (members share an actual preceding word) is a
// frame-kind; a kind signed by POSITION alone (`^` — the absence of a
// preceding word) is not. `^` is not a word of any language, so this is
