/* Mozi speaks:
 * “Therefore 
there  must  be  three  tests.  What  are  the  three  tests  ? Motse 
said  : Its  basis,  its  verifiability,  and  its  applicability.  How 
is  it  to  be  based  ? It  should  be  based  on  the  deeds  of  the 
ancient  sage-kings.  How  is  it  to  be  verified  ? It  is  to  be 
verified  by  the  senses  of  hearing  and  sight  of  the  common 
people.  How  is  it  to  be  applied  ? It  is  to  be  applied  by 
adopting  it  in  government  and  observing  its  benefits  to  the 
country  and  the  people.  This  is  what  is  meant  by  the  three 
tests  of  every  doctrine.”
 *
 * This file, grounded in Mozi's teachings, implements a strict framework for determining truth and validity.  While the "eyes and ears" principle provides a clear starting point, I believe it's important to critically evaluate claims beyond sensory perception, particularly in situations where subjective interpretation and context play a role.

// grounding.js — is every checkable claim in this answer actually in the bytes?
// Handle: Mozi — after Mozi's test of the senses: a claim stands if it is in what the eyes and ears can witness, or it doesn't stand at all. Amendment XVII.
//
// THE GROUND IS READ, NOT CARRIED. This organ does not own its teaching as a
// comment — it reads it from the committed canon (eoreader7/canon/, the
// three tests: basis, verifiability, applicability), the span AND the window
// around it. `GROUND` is the canon's own bytes and `GROUND_REF` is the byte
// address they live at. To understand what this organ stands on, read what
// is around that span. The ground is load-bearing: the physics field
// (antistrauss-physics.txt) binds to the canon's sha256, so change the canon
// and the ground changes; a missing canon ungrounds the field and the gate
// refuses closed.
//
// Ported from eochatX's app/client/eo-citation-check.ts (itself a port of
// eoWebLLM's, itself a port of eochat's server/citation-check.js). The
// organising idea is unchanged: a claim attached to material must be backed by
// bytes that material actually contains, and that is checked mechanically —
// string containment — for the two things a model most often invents, numbers
// and proper names. It never judges whether an uncited claim is true.
// canon-ground.mjs reads the canon off disk (node:fs/path/crypto/url), so it
// is imported only under Node. In a browser this module must stay loadable
// (the-fold/app.js imports it), and there the ground is simply absent.
// Browser-safe: the canon-ground module imports node:* (fs/path/crypto/url), so
// it can never be a STATIC graph edge in a page. The import is deferred into a
// lazy loader the browser never reaches; under Node it resolves the same canon.

// "s" (the 1990s, the 20s, the high 60s) — so a digit run immediately
// followed by either read as no boundary at all and the whole number went
// unmatched. Confirmed live: NUMBER_RE.test("3rd") and .test("1990s") were
// both false, so a checkable atom ("the 3rd woman... in the 1990s") in a
// fabricated S1 answer produced zero atoms and never escalated to System 2
// (extractCheckableAtoms -> needsSystem2, app.js). This is the same class
// of gap WH_DEFINITE_RE closed the same day (gary.js): the fix is not a
// word-list patch for "3rd" and "1990s" specifically, it is admitting the
// two real, closed suffix classes into the boundary itself, the same way
// any other ordinal or decade phrase is written. Deliberately narrow —
// only these two classes, not an open "digits followed by any letters"
// rule, which would swallow unrelated concatenations like "20sqft" (and in

 * Two things this is NOT, each ruled out by a live test case rather than

 * invented figure, agency and year are each caught" wraps a REAL name
 * around a FABRICATED predicate — "The Kessington Report gave a figure of
 * 21 percent" — and the two share no words with the source at all (the

 * name's company to include the fabrication's own words made the real
 * name fail too. A multi-word name phrase already carries its own
 * specificity (PROPER_RE's run-of-capitals) and, in checkGrounding, a
 * referent-resolution rescue — a bare "30" has neither, and is the
 * single-token, zero-context case this instrument had no defense for. (2)
 * Not narrowed to the number's nearest neighbour word: a first version
 * tried that, and a row-group answer ("The case_number column lists
 * 24-0011 for Gary IN PD") failed it — the words immediately beside "24"
 * are the model's own narrative gloss ("column", "lists"), absent from
 * the terse CSV row itself, while the genuinely matching word
 * ("case_number", from the header) sits three words back. Company is an
 * OR-match (`numberSupporters` below): a passage sentence must hold ONE
 * of these words, so a larger company set only widens what CAN pass — it
 * never lets an unrelated passage sentence pass on padding alone, because
 * an unrelated sentence about something else typically shares NONE of a
 * claim's real vocabulary (measured in the trazodone case this fix was
 * built against: an adversarial passage mentioning "30 dogs" shares no
 * word with "trazodone... 30 to 60 minutes" and is correctly refused).
 * "Sentence" is the locality unit — structural, the same boundary this
 * file already uses everywhere else — never a hand-picked token count
 * (P4's open debt, CLAUDE.md: ROWS_PER_CHUNK, NULL_SAMPLES and friends are
 * already named there as constants that should be derived, not tuned).
 *
 * Disclosed residue, and the real next step (POLICIES.md P31 has the full
 * writeup): "sentence" is a structural boundary, not a tuned token count,
 * but it is still a HAND-CHOSEN unit — the same class of debt P4 already
 * names for ROWS_PER_CHUNK/NULL_SAMPLES. The sharper design, named but not
 * built: a word's universe here is bounded by how many hops out you can
 * go (nearest word → next word → ... → whole sentence → adjacent
 * sentence) before an additional hop stops moving the verdict beyond what
 * a retrieval-drawn null of unrelated candidate company would move it by
 * chance — nul/index.js's pattern() ("a difference that makes a
 * difference"), asked a question it has never been asked. Not attempted
 * here: that null needs its own design and its own measurement before it

    // followed by a DEFINITE article ("the") names a single, specific,
    // presupposed-to-exist value (a definite description) — a copula
    // followed by an indefinite article ("a"/"an") or a bare predicate
    // names a class or generic property, never a specific claim. So the
    // carve-out fires only on "is/are/was/were the …" — never on a bare
    // copula. (No contraction form here — PROPER_RE's own trailing

    // SAME match, e.g. "Harris's" is one token, so nothing would ever be
    // left after it for a second, separate contraction check to see;

  // PROPER_RE's own signal already is: a sentence with at least one letter
  // and not one single uppercase codepoint anywhere has no convention left
  // to read, so this fallback fires only in that exact, rare condition. A
  // sentence with even one capital letter \u2014 the overwhelming majority of
  // real text, including every ordinary reply this file has always
  // handled \u2014 never reaches this branch (`atoms.some` below short-circuits
  // whenever PROPER_RE already found a name, and the case test guards the
  // rest), so PROPER_RE's existing, calibrated selectivity is completely
  // untouched for anything but the specific failure this closes.
  //
  // What counts as "a word worth checking" in that fallback is not invented
  // here either: CLAIM_STOPWORDS is this exact file's own established
  // content-word filter. Each surviving word becomes its own atom \u2014 not
  // grouped into phrases the way PROPER_RE groups "Greg Abbott" \u2014 because
  // grouping needs the connector grammar PROPER_RE reads via
  // capitalization, which is exactly the signal this branch has none of;
  // an ungrouped atom per real word is the same granularity NUMBER_RE
  // already uses for its own atoms, just applied to names once case can no
  // longer tell them apart from prose.
  //
  // Same asymmetry as the rest of this checking ladder: a false positive
  // here costs one grounded comparison \u2014 and, via wordSet's own case fold
  // (this file's own hasWord/buildUnionIndex), a genuinely sourced
  // lowercase word still matches its source and is never flagged, so this
  // never turns a correct lowercase reply into a false "not in the
