//
// A System 2 record is only worth more than a paraphrase because its refs can
// be read back. That requires material with addresses, so this module holds
// the smallest honest version of one: paste text, it is chunked at paragraph
// boundaries, every chunk knows its byte range, and retrieval is mechanical
// term overlap. No model chooses anything here.
//
// Two rules this module exists to obey:
//   - The model does not get tools. Whether a turn retrieves is a
//     deterministic function of the question's own words, not a decision the
//     model makes.
//   - Whatever cannot be addressed is a typed gap, never a guess. A chunk with
//     no term overlap is simply absent; nothing is invented to fill it.

 * Diacritic folding, the same fold everywhere: a corpus that writes Bezúkhov

 * accented name in them was flagged "not in the material"). The engine had
 * the same bug in the opposite state (CLAUDE.md); one shared fold is the fix
 * for the class, not the instance.
 *
 * Widened for the same reason a second time (2026-08-28): a vocalized Hebrew
 * corpus (nikud — real material, fetched live from the Talmud) and an
 * unvocalized question are the identical Bezúkhov/Bezukhov shape one script

/**
 * A text reduced to its WORDS AND ITS STOPS: diacritics folded, case folded,
 * every sentence-terminal run collapsed to one canonical stop, and every
 * other mark — typesetting rather than vocabulary — reduced to a word
 * boundary. Letters and numbers of any script survive; nothing else does.
 *
 * This exists because a model does not retype a source's BYTES, it retypes
 * its WORDS. The bytes of a book carry curly quotation marks, curly
 * apostrophes, em and en dashes and the ellipsis glyph; a model's retyping of
 * the same passage carries straight quotes, hyphens, three dots, and a comma
 * that drifted. Measured on War and Peace (audit 2026-08-16): a full
 * transcription of a chunk read as reproduction byte-exact and as clean prose
 * once its punctuation was straightened — across a third of the corpus, and
 * dropping the commas alone was enough on its own. A fold that stops at
 * diacritics therefore lets a photocopy pass as an answer, which is P11's own
 * lesson (one fold, applied to BOTH sides of every containment) arriving one
 * drift class later.
 *
 * The stop is the one mark that is NOT typesetting, and it is kept
 * deliberately. Where a source's sentence ENDS is the source's own structure,
 * and reproducing that boundary is what separates transcribing a passage from
 * extracting a clause out of one: an answer that lifts "Dredging of the
 * channel runs through March" and stops where the source does not has
 * selected something; an answer that runs to the source's full stop and halts
 * there has copied. Both readings are already pinned in holon.test.mjs, one
 * in each direction, and both survive this fold — which a blanket
 * punctuation strip does not (it condemns the extraction).
 *
 * The word rule is not invented here: `\p{L}\p{N}` is exactly the boundary
 * grounding.js's containment index already splits on, so the two organs read
 * "the same words" the same way. Unicode classes, not `[a-z0-9]`, because a
 * Cyrillic or CJK corpus must fold to its words and not to nothing — a fold
 * that silently emptied on another script would make the checks that use it
 * go blind rather than wrong, which is worse (II.13's own scar).
 *
 * Distinct from quotes.js's `normalizedIndex`, deliberately: that fold must
 * keep a map back to the original characters (it addresses bytes) and must
 * keep the difference between "byte equal" and "found under the fold" — that
 * difference IS its verbatim/drifted verdict. This one answers a coarser
 * question, "are these the source's words, in the source's order, to the
 * source's own stops", and can afford to shed everything else. Both stand on
 * foldDiacritics; neither is a second fold of the first's job.

 * Blank a flattened TABLE region, length-preserving, so a clause extractor

 * hard-wrapped prose (Gutenberg wraps at ~70-80 chars) puts subject and verb
 * on different physical lines, and refusing to cross a newline would lose
 * most of a book. That assumption is simply FALSE inside a table that has
 * been flattened to one cell per line: there the newline is a cell boundary,
 * not a wrap, so the extractor glues the end of one row to the start of the
 * next and manufactures a triple neither row states. Measured on the real
 * fetched Hannibal Hamlin article, whose infobox flattens to:
 *
 *     15th Vice President of the United States
 *     In office
 *     March 4, 1861   - March 4, 1865

 * THE CLASS, NOT THE LABELS. Nothing here knows "Preceded by", "In office" or
 * "Succeeded by", and adding them would rebuild `succession.js` — the module
 * this repo condemned precisely because per-site formatting rules cannot
 * generalise (CLAUDE.md, 2026-08-28). What IS general is the FORM: a run of
 * consecutive lines that are short and carry no sentence terminator is a
 * table's cells, whatever language or site produced it, because a sentence
 * that ends without terminal punctuation and fits in a cell is not a
 * sentence. Same discipline as `segments.js`'s heading detector one organ
 * over — a heading is form, not content — and the same discipline
 * `grounding.js::blankStructure` already holds for fenced code: the point is
 * never to UNDERSTAND the region, only to keep a prose reader out of a place
 * where prose is not what is written.
 *
 * DECLARED, NEVER DEFAULTED (P4/P9). `minRun` and `maxCell` are the caller's
 * to state: how many rows make a table, and how long a line can be and still
 * be a cell, are facts about the material a caller is reading, not constants
 * this module gets to pick. There is no default.
 *
 * LENGTH-PRESERVING, and scoped by the caller. Every blanked character is
 * replaced by a space, so the returned string indexes identically to the one
 * handed in and any offset taken against either still names the same place —
 * the same contract `blankStructure` holds. It is the CALLER's job to run
 * this only on an extraction copy: the real bytes must keep reaching
 * citations, retrieval, and the model.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM. It removes a table from the clause extractor's
 * view; it does not read the table. The facts in that infobox are real and
 * recoverable — by a table reader, which is a different organ (P59's shape
 * recognisers are the live direction). Nothing here has been measured to
 * improve any downstream grounding score, and this docstring is not the

 * Each chunk's own span of a WHOLE-PAGE furniture blanking, attached as

 * turned to spaces, decided with the whole document in view.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, MEASURED. `blankLabelRows` calls something furniture only
 * when it sees `minRun` CONSECUTIVE cells. Its one consumer
 * (`hypergraph.js::readSentenceText`) applied it to ONE SENTENCE of ONE
 * already-chunked passage, and the median chunk of a real Wikipedia page is
 * 31-72 characters — so a navbox is atomised into one-bullet passages and a
 * run of four can never form. Measured on three real fixtures: blanking as
 * shipped removed 286 / 1157 / 742 characters where blanking the whole page
 * removes 16176 / 14963 / 47098 — 13x to 63x more furniture, and the
 * difference is not the sentence boundary (per-sentence and per-passage agree
 * at 1.000 / 1.000 / 0.852) but the PASSAGE boundary. The evidence for a run
 * lives across chunks, so the decision has to be taken where the page still
 * exists, which is here.
 *
 * `chunk.text` IS NEVER TOUCHED, so every existing address still reads back;
 * this only ever ADDS a parallel copy for extraction to read.
 *
 * THE READBACK GATE, and it is not decoration — it was found by running this
 * against real Gutenberg books. `chunk.text` is `body.trim()` while
 * `start`/`end` span the UNTRIMMED body (chunkProse, above), so a chunk's
 * text is not always `text.slice(start, end)`: 66 of 2,249 Pride and
 * Prejudice chunks carry leading whitespace inside their own span, shifted by
 * up to 34 characters, and 1,218 of 36,837 do in the complete Shakespeare.
 * Slicing the blanked page at `[start, end]` would hand those chunks a window
 * shifted left by exactly that much — and a shifted window has EXACTLY the
 * right length, so a length check cannot see it. Measured against the naive
 * design on Pride and Prejudice: 60 chunks corrupted. So this LOCATES the
 * chunk's own text inside its span and slices the blanked page there.
 *
 * The delimited path is a slice too, not a reconstruction: `chunkRows` takes
 * `body` and strips one trailing newline, so its rows read back and DO
 * receive a copy — an earlier note here claimed they never match, which was
 * an artifact of comparing with strict equality against a span that carries
 * that trailing newline. What is true of them is disclosed in the tests
 * instead: a CSV's rows are short lines without terminal punctuation, so this
 * blanker calls a data table furniture — and did so before this change too,
 * since the whole table lands in one chunk that already met `minRun` on its
 * own.
 *
 * A chunk receives a copy only when that copy is verifiably ITS OWN text with
 * nothing but spaces substituted — same length, every position either
 * identical or blanked. Anything else keeps no `blanked` field and its
 * consumer falls back, unchanged. P5.2's discipline applied to this mechanism
 * itself: a parallel copy that cannot be shown to be the same text is not a
 * parallel copy.
 *
 * WHAT THE PER-CHARACTER CHECK DOES NOT PROVE, stated because it is the
 * gate's one blind spot: it proves the copy differs from this chunk's text
 * only by blanking. It does NOT prove alignment, because a window that is
 * entirely spaces passes every position trivially — which is the intended
 * shape for every navbox row. Alignment rests on locating the text
 * unambiguously, which is why an ambiguous or out-of-range span is refused
 * below rather than resolved by guesswork.

 * ground/difference/isGap apparatus: a boundary is only real when the
 * accumulated ground actually FAILS a declared, null-corrected test, never
 * a structural rule dressed as a finding). "Born rule" in that module's own

 * anywhere) — the same honest borrowing applies here, one register down:
 * chunkSource's own blank-line split, which used to BE the final chunk
 * boundary, becomes only the CANDIDATE set a licensed test then filters.
 *
 * Blank lines stay the candidate set rather than something finer (sentences,
 * fixed-width windows) because they are cheap, already computed by
 * chunkProse, and every real boundary this module could ever place has to
 * fall ON one anyway (chunkByBoundaries only ever cuts a passage at a blank
 * line or a supplied boundary — never mid-paragraph). Testing candidates
 * that could never become a boundary regardless of the test's answer would
 * cost real computation for no possible finding.
 *
 * `organs` is `{ causalSurprisalSeries, readAtmosphere, regime }` — the
 * first two imported straight from packages/engine (material.js,
 * loops/atmosphere.js), `regime` the declared `{ window, draws, tolerance,
 * hop }` a caller must supply explicitly (never defaulted here — the same
 * "declared, never a default" discipline atmosphere.js's own header
 * enforces for these exact four numbers). Reuse packages/host/terrains.js's
 * own ATMOSPHERE_REGIME ({ window: 5, draws: 256, tolerance: 3, hop: 5 })
 * rather than re-deriving a second set of numbers for the identical
 * question at a different call site.
 *
 * Returns `null` — a typed "declined", not an empty array standing in for
 * one — when there isn't enough candidate material to license the test at
 * all (readAtmosphere's own MIN_GROUND floor, calibrated at 10x window in
 * atmosphere.js, needs roughly that many paragraphs before it can report
 * anything) or when the organs themselves report a gap for any other
 * reason. The caller (chunkSource) falls back to the ordinary blank-line
 * split in that case — a short paste or a small attachment cannot support
 * a statistical test of its own paragraph breaks, and pretending otherwise
 * would be the exact "manufactured precision" this codebase refuses

 * into the result is the same offset into the input (P5.2, and the same
 * discipline `blankLabelRows` above already holds).
 *
 * WHY A RUN AND NOT A LINE. Measured (eval/the-fold/results/
 * cross-format-RESULTS.md): a bare length threshold scores F1 0.769 on a
 * document whose paragraphs are single lines and **0.148** on the SAME content
 * hard-wrapped at 72 columns — recall 0.091, one prose line in eleven. Hard
 * wrapping is what a PDF's text layer IS. Wrapping destroys per-line length
 * and PRESERVES the paragraph: a wrapped paragraph is a run of lines at the
 * wrap column ending in a short one, a table is a run of short lines. Asking
 * about the run instead of the line scored 0.936 on that same wrapped
 * rendering, and 0.641 / 0.670 / 0.648 on three real pages where the
 * threshold scored 0.639 / 0.654 / 0.618 — at precision 0.909-0.916 against
 * 0.821-0.915, with junk admitted falling from 73-77% to 8-9%.
 *
 * The short line that ENDS a paragraph is kept by adjacency, which is the
 * whole reason a run is the unit. A LONE filling line is not a paragraph (a
 * wide table row, a long heading) and is blanked.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS NAMED. No format, no site, no vocabulary: the measure comes
 * from the caller and everything else is a line's own length relative to it.
 *
 * `fill` and `minRun` are declared. `fill` is what fraction of the measure a
 * line must reach; `minRun` is how many filling lines make a paragraph, and
 * two is the structural floor for the same reason `blankLabelRows` gives —
 * one line is not a run.
