/* Zhengming speaks:
 * “If  names  be  not  correct,  language  is  not  in 
accordance  with  the  truth  of  things.     If  language  be 
not  in  accordance  with  the  truth  of  things,   affairs 
cannot  be  carried  on  to  success.”

 * This file implements the essential principle of a name's referential connection, aligning with the Confucian ideal of truth and accurate representation.  However, the file's implementation of this principle may be overly rigid, and its application could potentially lead to a reduction in the breadth and depth of the discourse.

// cast.js — names resolve to referents, not to strings.
// Handle: Zhengming — after Confucius's rectification of names: a name answers to its referent, not to its string. Amendment XVII.
//
// Measured motivation, in order: the grounding check flagged "Pierre
// Bezukhov" as not-in-the-material against the very chapters that name him,
// because containment compared byte sequences. A diacritic fold fixed that
// instance and missed the class — no string rule makes "Pierre" support
// "Bezukhov". What makes any of these equivalent is that they point to the
// same REFERENT, and referent discovery is an organ the engine already has:
// surfaces.js's extractSurfaces (candidate names by the text's own
// capitalisation physics) and discoverReferents (name-variant coreference at
// engine tier — containment and shared final token, generic tokens stripped
// so two Princesses never merge). Descriptor synonymy and pronoun binding
// stay model-tier gaps there, and therefore stay unsupported here — this
// resolver rescues exactly what the engine can derive, nothing further.
//
// Pure, organs injected: the engine's functions arrive as arguments, because
// this module is imported by both the page (which loads them from /engine)
// and the node tests (which load them by relative path). The organs are
// used, never copied — the fold discipline (diaNorm's disclosed-narrow
// scope) rides in with them.
//
// THE FURNITURE WALL, closed 2026-09-04 (rashomon-contrast-RESULTS.md's own
// named next step: "the cast's own universe has no such wall"). Measured on
// the real fetched Battle of Borodino page: a six-line succession-box
// passage ("Preceded by / Battle of Mesoten / Napoleonic Wars / Battle of
// Borodino / Succeeded by / French occupation of Moscow") and a bottom-page
// navbox both fed `extractSurfaces`/`discoverReferents` their own link text,
// which then MERGED with real people — Barclay de Tolly and Pyotr Bagration
// fused into one referent carrying the infobox abbreviation "DOW". This was
// never a gap in `blankLabelRows` itself: `source.js::chunkSource`'s own
// `blankFurniture` option already computes a page-aware `chunk.blanked`
// field for exactly this (P82) — verified live, that field is furniture-free
// where this file's own `.text` read was not.
//
// THE GATE, and why it is not a bare `p.blanked ?? p.text`. `hypergraph.js`
// already enforces, and tests (`source-page-blanking.test.mjs`, "a reader
// that never asked for blanking does not get it from the chunker"), the
// rule this file must not quietly break: A CALLER'S OWN INJECTED ORGAN IS
// AUTHORITATIVE, never a side channel it has no relationship with. A first
// cut here read `.blanked` unconditionally whenever a chunk happened to
// carry one — which broke exactly that test, because `hypergraph.js`
// builds its OWN internal referent index by calling
// `makeReferentIndex(organs)` with its whole `organs` bundle, so a reader
// that was NOT given `blankFurniture` (by design, in that test) was
// suddenly seeing page-scoped blanking anyway, through this file's own
// referent resolution rather than through the sentence-text path the test
// was actually checking. Fixed the same way `readSentenceText` already
// gates it: `.blanked` is consulted only when THIS caller's own
// `blankFurniture` (any truthy value — the function is never invoked here,
// only checked, since the blanking itself already happened at `chunkSource`
// time) says so. Omit it entirely and behaviour is byte-identical to
// before this fix, for both a chunk with no `.blanked` field and one that
// has it. `hypergraph.js` needed no change at all: its own `organs` bundle
// already carries `blankFurniture`, and `makeReferentIndex(organs)` was
// already passing the whole bundle through.
//
// Measured effect on the real fixture, WITH `blankFurniture` opted in: the
// two fused garbage referents disappear entirely; Barclay de Tolly's
// surname reappears as its own real (if still partial) referent rather
// than fused into Bagration's. See cast.test.mjs for both the opted-in and
// opted-out cases, pinned against the real fixture and against a synthetic
// leak-check mirroring `source-page-blanking.test.mjs`'s own.
//
// STILL OPEN, disclosed rather than implied closed: opting in is still each
// caller's own act. `app.js`'s three cast.js call sites and this repo's
// `rashomon-contrast.mjs` now pass `blankFurniture`; other eval drivers
// that build a cast from `chunkSource`'d passages without it are unchanged
// and still see raw text here, named rather than swept in silently.
