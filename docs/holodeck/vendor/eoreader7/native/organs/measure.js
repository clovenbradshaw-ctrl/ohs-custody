// measure.js — a figure is a placement, or it is refused.
// Handle: Fisher — after Ronald Fisher's permutation test: a figure is a placement against a null built by shuffling, or it is refused. Amendment XVII.
// See also: the reading-competency audit applies exactly this method (a
// scrambled-word-order null + a one-sided Fisher exact test) to reading
// pipelines themselves — github.com/clovenbradshaw-ctrl/reading-training
//
// The fold could already draw a table and a bar chart from a loaded file's own
// bytes (tables.js, artifact.js::chartFrom). What it could not do is say
// whether anything in those bytes is more than the file's own arithmetic — so
// the moment a reader wanted that, the analysis got hand-rolled somewhere else.
// The dfr-causal-analysis repo is what that looks like at scale: four Node
// scripts importing eoreader6 by an absolute path on one laptop, three Python
// scripts hand-rolling their own permutation nulls with `random.shuffle`, and
// two more (coverage_equity.py, instrument_feasibility.py) reporting weighted
// averages and medians with no null in them at all — in a repo whose own
// plain-language writeup says "never report a number."
//
// So this is the door. Everything statistical here is eoreader6's, imported and
// never copied: `nul/index.js` builds the nothing and places the observation,
// `emergence/binding.js` tests co-arrival per pair. What this module adds is
// the part the engine deliberately leaves to its callers, and the part a person
// most needs taken out of their hands:
//
//   THE GATE. nul says so about its own licensing table in as many words —
//   "NOT enforced inside `ground` ... An organ that wants the guarantee asks
//   for it." This organ asks for it. A statistic paired with a perturbation
//   nobody has established is refused here, by name, with the material each
//   established pair WAS earned on, so the refusal teaches instead of just
//   blocking.
//
// Five things cannot get through this door, and each one is a way a real
// analysis has gone wrong in this project's own history:
//
//   1. a figure with no nothing behind it  → `no_ground`
//      (coverage_equity.py: 157 lines, zero nulls, publishable-looking numbers)
//   2. an unestablished statistic/perturbation pair → `unlicensed_pair`
//      (nul's Amendment I: a licence earned on one statistic carries no ground
//       for another — recorded as prose there, refused as code here)
//   3. a rank phrased finer than the draws can carry → capped, always
//      (the paper's own §6: "several call sites use 12 resamples. A 95th
//       percentile cannot be meaningfully estimated from 12 draws")
//   4. several observations placed against a one-arrival ground → `best_of_n`
//      (nul::extremeGround's measured table: at n=200 a one-arrival ground
//       ranks pure noise at 0.010 and calls a quarter of trials surfeit)
//   5. a number left to a default → `undeclared`, naming which one
//
// And one thing is NOT refused, deliberately: a censored placement. Outside the
// support the magnitude is real and the ground simply cannot supply a place —
// that is a finding about the material, phrased as one, never an error and
// never upgraded into a result.
//
// Pure, organs injected: `nul` and the binding organs arrive as arguments,
// because this module is imported by both the page (which loads them from
// /engine and /nul) and the node tests (which load them by relative path). The
// cast.js pattern, for the same reason cast.js has it.
