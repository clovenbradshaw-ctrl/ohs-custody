// identity does not") applied to fetched material instead of conversational
// turns: a page nobody has cited after a while is not deleted (the history
// LINE stays, append-only, forever — P13's own rule) — only its full SAVED
// TEXT is replaced with the mechanical fold `fetchAndKeep` already computes
// on every fetch (foldExtract's own coverage summary, never a paraphrase),
// so what remains is the page's own shape rather than its every byte.
