// hypergraph.js — relation-level grounding: the answer read against the
// edges the material itself binds. P12's named future work, wired.
//
// The tier below this (grounding.js) asks whether the answer's TOKENS are in
// the bytes. This tier asks whether the answer's RELATIONS are: "Pierre
// married Dolokhov" passes every byte check — Pierre is in the material,
// married is in the material, Dolokhov is in the material — and is still an
// invention, because the text never bound that edge. Only a reading of the
// material's own relation structure can catch it, and only a reading of the
// answer WITH THE SAME ORGANS can be compared against it honestly.
//
// Everything measured here is the engine's: relation vocabulary is
// discovered, never typed in (perceiver/text/relations.js — the 90-word
// hand list was that file's own measured mistake); triples are extracted
// with polarity read, never asserted; endpoints resolve to REFERENTS
// through the same index cast.js's resolver projects (one implementation of
// "the same name", P11). This module composes those organs and types the
// verdicts; it measures nothing of its own.
//
// THE VERDICTS ARE FOUR-PLUS-ONE, NEVER A BIT. The field converged on this
// the hard way (FEVER's supported/refuted/not-enough-info; SAFE's
// supported/irrelevant/unsupported; AIS's "uninterpretable" refusal — see
// the prior-art survey in the PR that introduced this file): support,
// contradiction, absence of evidence, and beyond-the-instrument's-reach are
// FOUR DIFFERENT FACTS, and collapsing any two of them lies in one
// direction or the other.
//
//   bound        — the material binds this edge, same polarity. Carries the
//                  addresses that state it, and its corroboration: how many
//                  passages, across how many distinct sources. Support is
//                  graded by independent perspectives, never a boolean.
//   contradicted — the material binds this edge with the OPPOSITE polarity
//                  ("never married" against "married"). The most valuable
//                  finding this tier produces, and invisible to every byte
//                  check by construction.
//   unbound      — subject resolves, verb is in the material's own measured
//                  vocabulary, and no edge binds them: the "Pierre married
//                  Dolokhov" case. Carries the NEAREST edges the material
//                  does bind (same subject and verb, or same verb and
//                  object) so the reader sees what the text says instead —
//                  the affordance that turns a flag into an explanation.
//                  Sometimes carries `competing` too (added 2026-08-19,
//                  P32's named follow-up): when the material binds this
//                  EXACT verb+object to one and only one OTHER subject —
//                  "the Pirates won the 1960 World Series" against a claim
//                  the Yankees did — that is stronger evidence than an
//                  ordinary neighbour, gated on the object resolving to a
//                  referent and on every edge sharing the slot pointing to
//                  the SAME subject (a slot the material shows filled by
//                  two+ different subjects proves nothing and stays plain
//                  unbound). This is the mechanical half of what testimony.js's
//                  witness tier covers semantically for everything a
//                  subject-swap cannot reach structurally — see P32.
//   beyond-reach — an endpoint does not resolve to any referent this
//                  material establishes (a pronoun subject, an abstract
//                  object). This tier cannot read the claim, and says so —
//                  disclosed as unreadable, never implied false.
//   unheard      — the claim's verb is outside the vocabulary the material
//                  itself measures. Same posture: the instrument's reach
//                  ends here, and the omission stays visible (the CLAUDE.md
//                  rule about lens-less terrains, applied to verbs).
//
// Pure, organs injected (the cast.js pattern): the engine's functions
// arrive as arguments because this module is imported by both the page
// (which loads them from /engine) and the node tests (which load them by
// relative path). The organs are used, never copied.
//
// AMENDED 2026-08-18 — recurring forms as a second, weaker identity for
// endpoint resolution. `beyond-reach`'s own justification above ("a
// pronoun subject, an abstract object") describes only PART of what was
// driving that verdict: measured against MINE-1 (an external benchmark of
// 105 short informational essays, goldens/EXTERNAL-BENCHMARKS.md),
// beyond-reach was firing on ordinary, non-abstract, non-pronoun common
// nouns — "butterflies", "caterpillars" — subjects a concept-scale
// document states real relations about, that simply never get named the
// way cast.js's referent index requires (a proper name, or a pronoun
// resolved through its own floor). host/terrains.js's Network-graph organ
// had already solved exactly this starvation, for the graph surface, not
// this one: recurring-form co-arrival binding, built because "concept
// documents starve the cast ladder" (measured there on SEED-SPEAKER.md).
// `endpoint()` now grants a subject or object the SAME identity — a
// content word recurring at least FORM_MIN_ARRIVALS sentences in the
// material — namespaced `form:<word>` so it can never be mistaken for a
// cast referent, and every claim built on one is marked `formBased` so a
// reader can tell a form-anchored "bound" from a name-anchored one. This
// widens what the tier can READ; it fabricates nothing — the SAME edges
// extractRelations already found in the material, now checkable because
// their subject can finally resolve. Measured effect, not assumed: see
// the-fold/eval/mine-1-forms-RESULTS.md.
//
// AMENDED 2026-08-19 — lemma-aware verb matching, and a dead end it
// replaced. "Check against other systems" (this tier's graph, scored
// under KGGen's own MINE-1 rubric, beat every reported baseline —
// the-fold/eval/results/mine-1-official-methodology-RESULTS.md) prompted
// "wire this in." The first attempt widened `bound` itself with a sixth
// verdict, `inferred`, covering a claim from a NEIGHBORHOOD of connected
// edges rather than one. Built, then found ADVERSARIALLY (not by luck —
// by asking what the obvious next attack was) to fabricate on two real
// cases: "Pierre married Dolokhov" passed because Pierre and Dolokhov are
// connected by real, unrelated edges and a one-token object costs nothing
// to cover; tightened to require the claimed verb nearby too, "Pierre
// painted delicate watercolors" STILL passed — reproduced live — because
// hopping through the unrelated "Pierre admired Natasha" edge let
// Natasha's own action get attributed to Pierre. The only fix that closed
// both was dropping graph traversal entirely and pooling only a subject's
// OWN other statements — which is provably, then empirically (0/1,575
// fires on MINE-1), dead code: `bound`'s own object match (`tokensShare`)
// already accepts ANY single shared token with ONE edge, a strictly
// weaker bar than "every token covered by a union of edges" over the
// SAME primitive, so nothing safe built from that primitive can ever
// clear a bar `bound` hasn't already cleared first. The real lesson: the
// 80% score's power came from two things this tier's own law (P1, local
// only; P4/P20, a model is never trusted to decide a fact is supported)
// correctly refuses to mechanize — real semantic embeddings and a real
// judge's relational reasoning. Widening graph REACH without either adds
// nothing safe can't already reach.
//
// What DOES add real, safe value: a DIFFERENT matching primitive, not a
// repackaging of the one `bound` already saturates. Every verb comparison
// in this file compared verbs by exact string equality — so a claim
// phrased "underwent metamorphosis" against material stating "undergoes
// metamorphosis," the identical predicate in a different tense, read as
// two different verbs and lost the claim, sometimes silently (a
// tense-shifted verb never literally in the vocabulary Set never even
// gets extracted from the answer to judge). `organs.createLemmatizer` /
// `organs.morphologyIndex` (perceiver/text/morphology.js, UniMorph-backed,
// irregular-inflection-aware, found this session by searching before
// writing anything new) widen verb equality to `sameAct` — the SAME lemma,
// never a fuzzy match: checked live that an unrelated verb sharing no
// lemma with the material stays refused. Optional and backward compatible
// exactly like `verbForms` above (omitted, `sameAct` degrades to exact
// match). Measured: bound 531 -> 536, unheard 48 -> 42, zero contradictions
// either way. Small, because MINE-1's own facts are close paraphrases of
// their source — real on every axis regardless. Whether the LIVE APP
// should load either prior by default remains the same open question
// this repo's CLAUDE.md already names for `verbForms` — not resolved
// here either.
//
// AMENDED SAME NIGHT — objects, and the language this whole mechanism was
// quarantined to. "Try it" (extending referent/form identity to OBJECTS,
// not just subjects — `useForms` had stayed subject-only by explicit
// prior design, with a disclosed but never-reproduced regression risk)
// reproduced the risk for real: "underwent transformations" read unbound
// against material stating "underwent a remarkable transformation,"
// because singular and plural independently became DISTINCT exact-token
// form ids. `formIdOf` fixes it by reusing the SAME `sameAct` organ —
// grouping a token with every other recurring form that is the same act
// as it, nouns exactly like verbs — and object identity is enabled ONLY
// when `createLemmatizer` is provided (`Boolean(createLemmatizer)` at
// both object call sites, never unconditionally), so the original
// regression cannot recur: without a lemmatizer, nothing changed. Then,
// asked directly whether any of this generalizes past English ("it needs
// to work for Ancient Greek, or we have high-level priors steering for
// different grammars"): checked, not assumed, and morphology.js's own
// regular-suffix RULE (unlike its properly-quarantined DATA layer) ran
// unconditionally regardless of what a loaded prior declared — fixed
// there (its own 2026-08-19 amendment), with `organs.morphologyLanguage`
// threading a prior's own declared language through automatically.
// Combined, measured, all at zero contradictions: bound 531 -> 557,
// beyond-reach 267 -> 236, headline 33.7% -> 35.4%. Full account:

 * `makeRelationReader(organs)` → `relationsFor(passages)` → a reader:
 *
 *   { examined, vocabulary, edges, read(answer) }
 *
 * `edges` is the material's own belief graph over these passages — every
 * edge keyed by referent identity where the index resolves one, carrying
 * every address that states it. `read(answer)` extracts the answer's
 * relation claims with the SAME vocabulary and organs and returns one typed
 * verdict per claim (shape above). Organs required: splitSentences,
 * extractSurfaces, discoverReferents, namesCorefer, diaNorm (the cast
 * organs), plus discoverRelationVocab, extractRelations, tokenize (the
 * relation organs). `relationsFor(passages, { pool })` — the pool is the
 * live corpus the closed-class measure runs over; omitted, the passages
 * stand in and the measure usually refuses itself (CORPUS_MINIMUM).
 *
 * EVERY claim `read()` returns also carries `endpoints`
 * (`{subject, object}`, each `"referent"` / `"form"` / `"tokens"` /
 * `"none"`): HOW each end actually resolved, so no downstream reader has
 * to infer an upstream finding from the shape of a refusal. `beyond-reach`
 * gates on the SUBJECT, so its ABSENCE says nothing at all about the
 * object — see `judge()`'s own comment for the measured specimen this
 * closes (POLICIES.md P41).
 *
 * `organs.determiners` — OPTIONAL, a received closed class (the engine's
 * own priors register: DEFINITE_DETERMINERS + INDEFINITE_DETERMINERS,
 * giver "lang/en"), excluded from an endpoint's comparable tokens. Exists
 * because `commonTerms`'s declared CORPUS_MINIMUM floor leaves the
 * function-word filter off entirely on small material, where a shared
 * definite article alone is enough for `tokensShare` to bind an object the
 * material never states. Omitted: byte-identical to every prior caller.
 *
 * `organs.definiteDeterminers` — OPTIONAL, a received closed class (priors.js's
 * own DEFINITE_DETERMINERS alone, giver "lang/en" — NEVER unioned with
 * INDEFINITE_DETERMINERS). Consumed only by `queryReferents`'s `foldLabel`,
 * below, to fold a bare/no-article-vs-"the" phrasing gap out of a verb
 * comparison. Kept separate from `organs.determiners` on purpose: folding
 * "a" together with "the" was tried first, sharing the combined set, and
 * adversarial falsification found it wrongly clusters "became A vice
 * president" (one of several) with "became THE vice president" (the sole
 * holder) as one slot — English's indefinite/definite distinction is often
 * the only marker of uniqueness, so it is a real, separate hazard class
 * from a bare/definite phrasing accident. Omitted: `foldLabel` degrades to
 * a case/whitespace-only fold, byte-identical to every prior caller.
 *
 * `organs.posPriorFor` — OPTIONAL, a zero-arg accessor (app.js's own lazy-
 * accessor pattern, the same shape as its `relationsFor`/`skillLibrary`/
 * `callModel` entries) returning a POSPrior@1 object or null. When it
 * returns real data, every edge and every claim (`read()`'s output) also
 * carries `grammar` — perceiver/text/wordclass.js's real, treebank-measured
 * answer to "is this connector's FORM actually a verb", cross-validating
 * discoverRelationVocab's own SLOT-only measurement without ever filtering
 * it (2026-08-19: "we now have an infinitely richer hypergraph with parts
 * of speech", user direction, after a live "party" false-verb specimen).
 * Omitted, or not yet resolved: `grammar` is `null` everywhere, and
 * everything else is byte-identical to before this existed.
 *
 * `relationsFor(passages, { negationWords })` threads straight through to
 * discoverRelationVocab/extractRelations's own injected-prior seam
 * (relations.js, following bin/priors/lang/en.json's pattern in
 * eoreader6.1). Omitted, the engine's own English NEGATION_WORDS applies,
 * unchanged from before this option existed. Supplying a Set (e.g.
 * bin/priors/lang/eu.json's `negation` array for Basque) reads the
 * material's negation with that language's own vendored closed class
 * instead — never a second, hardcoded English list standing in for
 * material this tier was never measured against.
 *
 * Every edge additionally carries `assertion` — the extractor's own claim
 * about the material treated as a reader's hypothesis with disclosed
 * support (asserted.js): `standing` (`corroborated` at >= 2 independent
 * statements, `single-witness` below — the structural floor, givers named
 * there), `statements` (how many extracted occurrences folded into this
 * edge), and `verbSupport` (how many DISTINCT surfaces this verb followed
 * in the material's own vocabulary measure — a verb admitted on the
 * strength of one surface is itself a single-witness assertion). The
 * word-salad arm rides only behind `relationsFor(passages, { assert:
 * { draws, seed } })` — draws declared, never defaulted; the arm reports
 * counts (`orderArm: { draws, fired, seed }`), never a verdict, because no
 * cut has been earned (asserted.js's header carries the reasoning). None
 * of this convicts: relationFindings and relationsClean are unchanged, so
 * an edge's weak standing reaches the reader as disclosure, not as a mark
 * against the answer. `grammar` (treebank evidence) and `assertion`
 * (structural corroboration/word-salad) are two INDEPENDENT measures of
 * the same underlying concern — a connector's own FORM against real
 * language evidence, versus how much the material's own recurrence and a
 * shuffled-null back this specific edge — neither replaces the other, and
 * both ride the same edge/claim disclosed side by side.
 *
 * `organs.classifyConnector`/`organs.minShare` — OPTIONAL, injected the
 * cast.js way (Per-Source Testimony spec, BUILD-3): grammar-lens.js's own
 * `makeGrammarLens` output, moved here from capacity-runner.js's post-hoc
 * `checkConnectorClass` so an edge carries its own connector classification
 * from the moment it is extracted, not just at check time. Every edge also
 * carries `connectorClass` when both are supplied — see `classifyConnector`'s
 * own destructuring comment, further down this function, for the full
 * account of why this is a THIRD, separate field from `grammar` two
 * paragraphs up rather than a rename of it. `minShare` has no safe default
 * (grammar-lens.js's own header) and MUST be declared by whichever caller
 * supplies `classifyConnector` — omitted, `connectorClass` is `undefined`
 * on every edge, byte-identical to every caller before this pass existed.

/**
 * A pronoun subject is disclosed elsewhere in this file as noise, not a
 * claim about the cast (endpoint()'s own header two-doors down; POLICIES.md
 * has carried this as a named, open limitation since the assertion tier
 * landed). Measured live 2026-08-20 (real fetched material, the Lincoln/
 * Hamlin/Johnson question): "it says: He —was→ also the 16th vice
 * president" shipped to a reader with the pronoun unresolved, even though
 * the SAME passage names "Andrew Johnson" two sentences earlier — the
 * antecedent was sitting right there, unread. `pronouns.js::resolvePronouns`
 * already exists for exactly this (READING-POLICY P7.2: "a check on a name
 * asks about the referent, not the string") and was never wired into this
 * file. This composes it the way corpus.js already validated: PER PASSAGE,
 * never across passages — `relationsFor`'s own `list` is retrieved top-N
 * passages, often from unrelated pages/sites, and resolving a pronoun in one
 * against a name that only happens to occur in another would be exactly the
 * cross-document contamination P1's own activation-window discipline warns
 * against ("never carry a window across books"). Scoping `splitSentences` to
 * one passage's own text at a time means activation can only ever recall a
 * name that passage itself named. NOT the same `index` `endpoint()` uses for
 * referent matching elsewhere in this file, and deliberately so — see this
 * function's own header for the measured reason (cast.js's `minSentences: 0`
 * answers a different question than this organ needs asked).
 *
 * A resolved mention REWRITES the passage's extraction-only text (the
 * pronoun token replaced by the referent's most-individuated surface)
 * rather than patching the edge after extraction — because `extractRelations`
 * reads the connector's SLOT off raw text, and a rewrite lets subject role,
 * verb agreement, and everything downstream just work, the same reason
 * `blankFurniture` above rewrites text rather than post-processing triples.
 * Length-changing, unlike `blankFurniture` — safe here for the identical
 * reason that fix already established: this text feeds extraction only,
 * never an offset a citation depends on. An unresolved pronoun (below the
 * declared floor, gender-incompatible, or nothing named yet) is left
 * exactly as written — a typed gap upstream (pronouns.js's own `gaps`),
 * never a guess forced through.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT `cast.js`'s shared `index` — measured live 2026-08-20,
 * against real continuous Wikipedia prose, read in true document order:
 * zero pronoun hits were even ATTEMPTED. `cast.js::makeReferentIndex` calls
 * `discoverReferents(surfaces, { minSentences: 0 })` — its own header names
 * the reason, correctly, for what CAST membership means to a citation check
 * ("presence... a name mentioned once is present once"), which is a
 * DIFFERENT question from what `resolvePronouns` needs. `resolvePronouns`'s
 * own gate refuses any sentence carrying ANY named surface at all — and
 * with `minSentences: 0`, a one-off place name ("Greeneville", "Maryland")
 * gets promoted to full referent status exactly like "Johnson" does,
 * so it blocks the attempt just as hard. The REAL, validated pipeline this
 * organ was proven on (eoreader6.1's own corpus.js, on War and Peace) never
 * passes that override — `discoverReferents(surfaces, {})` uses its own
 * DERIVED recurrence floor (`deriveMinSentences`), so a name mentioned once
 * in passing never earns referent status and a truly recurring person (the
 * one a pronoun should recall) is what dominates activation. This function
 * runs that SAME derivation, scoped to the one passage being rewritten —
 * a second, differently-floored discovery pass, not the shared `index`,
 * because the two callers are asking genuinely different questions of the
 * identical material.

// ── the referent bar: a sentence-initial-only name, confirmed by a real
// pronoun binding ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Real, measured problem (the-fold, 2026-08-20): "Lincoln never appointed
// Hamlin. Someone else got the job." — two sentences, "Lincoln" only ever
// sentence-initial — computed undetermined, not because anything about the
// claim itself was wrong, but because `extractSurfaces` never looks at
// sentence-initial position for ANY surface (that function's own header:
// "capitalised runs, skipping the sentence-initial token — it is
// capitalised by position and carries no evidence of namehood on its
// own"), so "Lincoln" never even becomes a CANDIDATE, let alone a referent
// `endpoint()` below can resolve a subject against. This is L2's own rule
// working exactly as designed (a lone capitalized word that ONLY ever
// opens a sentence reads as position, not namehood) — but encyclopedia-
// lede-style writing (a subject named once, then referred to only by
// pronoun) can never clear this bar through recurrence alone, and that
// exact shape is the traced root cause behind several earlier
// `undetermined` results in this project's own history.
//
// User direction, verbatim, settling what would otherwise be an open
// design choice among several candidates: "I fundamentally think our
// concept of 'needs to appear more than once' is wrong — we need to count
// it being pointed to via pronouns as well." Concretely: a resolved
// pronoun binding contributes to the SAME `sentences` recurrence count
// `discoverReferents`'s own derived floor already compares every OTHER
// candidate against — never a second, separate corroboration signal
// bolted on after a decision already made on name-text recurrence alone.
//
// THE CIRCULARITY, AND HOW IT IS BROKEN. `resolvePronouns` needs a
// referent already admitted to serve as a binding target — but the whole
// point here is admitting a referent ORDINARY admission never sees at
// all. Broken in two passes: PASS 1 (`confirmLeadingReferents`)
// provisionally adds every leading-only candidate (surfaces.js's own new
// `extractLeadingSurfaces` — the mirror of `extractSurfaces`, exactly as
// evidence-free about namehood as "a capitalized word opened this
// sentence," see that function's own header) to a TEMPORARY, namespaced
// (`provisional:<slug>`, never colliding with a real `ref:auto:*` id) copy
// of this passage's own referent map, purely so `resolvePronouns` has
// something to test a pronoun against — nothing is admitted into the REAL
// index yet. PASS 2 runs `resolvePronouns` for real, at this file's own
// already-declared, already-justified operating point
// (`PRONOUN_MIN_ACTIVATION`/`PRONOUN_MIN_MARGIN` — the SAME numbers
// `resolvePronounSubjects` above already trusts, never a fresh number
// invented for this path), and ONLY a candidate a real binding actually
// resolved to (clearing that SAME floor, no exception, no relaxed bar) is
// CONFIRMED — carrying forward exactly the sentences its confirming
// bindings occupy into the SAME `discoverReferents` call
// (`minSentences: 0`, matching cast.js's own declared floor for this
// question — "presence... a name mentioned once is present once") every
// ordinarily-admitted referent already goes through. "Provisional" never
// leaks past `confirmLeadingReferents` — the real index only ever sees a
// candidate that already earned a real `sentences` count the derived
// floor can fairly compare against everything else, the identical bar,
// not a lowered one.
//
// SCOPED PER PASSAGE, for the SAME reason `resolvePronounSubjects` above
// already is (P38, this file: "never carry a window across books,"
// READING-POLICY P1): `list` may hold retrieved passages from unrelated
// pages, and resolving a pronoun in one against a name that only happens
// to occur in a DIFFERENT, unrelated one would be exactly the cross-
// document contamination that rule exists to prevent.
//
// DISCLOSED, NOT SILENTLY NARROWER THAN IT SOUNDS — a real, measured limit
// found WHILE building this, not assumed: this mechanism does NOT yet help
// the single most canonical shape of the problem it was built for — a name
// that opens the very FIRST sentence of a passage, referred to by pronoun
// for the rest of it (the exact "Hannibal Hamlin (dates) was..." / "He
// was..." Wikipedia-lede shape this section's own header names, and the
// exact 2-sentence "Lincoln never appointed Hamlin. Someone else got the
// job." specimen this whole investigation started from). Traced to the
// ROOT MECHANISM, not just the symptom: `emergence/activation.js::codeOf`
// scores a word's distinctiveness as `idfOf(w) = log(max(1,state.read) /
// max(1,df.get(w)))` — at `state.read` small (the first several sentences
// of ANY passage, before enough frames have been read for the ratio to
// separate anything), `idfOf` rounds to ~0 for EVERY word, universally,
// regardless of content, because nothing can look "rare" yet against an
// almost-empty read count. `codeOf`'s own gate (`if (s < idfFloor)
// continue`) then excludes EVERY word of that early frame from `trace`,
// which means `encodeFrame` never enters it into `posting` at all — a
// frame processed during this cold-start window is invisible to `recall`
// FOREVER after, not just weakly recalled, no matter how many later
// sentences echo its vocabulary. Measured directly, isolating the primitive
// from this file's own composition (raw `codeOf`/`recall`/`encodeFrame`,
// no pronoun machinery involved): a naming sentence at frame 0 stores an
// EMPTY trace (`traceKeys: []`) when encoded, and a later probe's own
// `recall()` never includes frame 0 in its activation map, however far
// downstream or however strongly a shared phrase repeats — while the
// IDENTICAL naming sentence, moved to frame 10 or frame 15 of the same
// passage (ten-plus sentences of ordinary preceding material), stores a
// full trace and IS correctly recalled later, proven end to end through
// this exact mechanism (`hypergraph.test.mjs`'s own cases, below). This is
// a property of `activation.js` itself — the same primitive `resolvePronouns`
// already depends on for every OTHER purpose too, including
// `resolvePronounSubjects` above — not a defect in this section's own
// composition; it was simply never named before because nothing had asked
// `activation.js` to recall a passage's own FIRST frame until this pass.
//
// WHY NOT WORKED AROUND HERE. Priming `state` with duplicate copies of the
// real early sentences does not help — it was checked, not assumed: a
// repeated word's df grows in exact lockstep with the priming reads, so
// `idfOf` stays at `log(1)=0` regardless of how many copies are fed in
// (IDF rewards RARITY relative to volume, and copying content raises both
// numerator and denominator together). Priming with UNRELATED filler
// sentences purely to advance `state.read` past the cold-start threshold
// before the real material begins might work mechanically, but is a new,
// unvalidated mechanism of its own (how much padding is enough is exactly
// the kind of number this codebase's own standing rule says must be
// measured against a null, never hand-picked) and was not attempted here —
// this file's own established preference, seen repeatedly elsewhere in it,
// is a disclosed real limit over a rushed fix under time pressure. The
// real fix belongs one level down, in `activation.js` itself: a caller-
// visible, DERIVED "minimum frames before recall is meaningful" signal
// (mirroring `deriveMinSentences`'s own derivation elsewhere in this
// codebase), so a caller can know, not guess, whether a cold-start frame's
// absence from `trace` means "nothing here" or "not enough has been read
// yet to tell." Real, scoped, unattempted future work, named here rather
// than silently left looking like this file's own oversight.

    /**
     * This passage's sentence i, rewritten locally for extraction only.
     *
     * FURNITURE IS BLANKED WITH THE PAGE IN VIEW WHEN THE CHUNKER SUPPLIED
     * THAT VIEW, and per sentence either way. `blankLabelRows` needs `minRun`
     * CONSECUTIVE cells to call anything furniture, and the median chunk of a
     * real page is 31-72 characters, so a navbox arrives already atomised into
     * one-bullet passages and the run can never form here — measured, 13x to
     * 63x less furniture blanked than the same organ sees when handed the
     * whole page (source.js::withPageBlanking carries the numbers). The
     * evidence for a run lives ACROSS chunks, so `chunkSource` takes the
     * decision where the page still exists and hands each chunk its own span
     * of the result as `chunk.blanked`, gated on a readback check.
     *
     * THE TWO SCOPES ARE ADDITIVE, NOT EXCLUSIVE. The page-scoped copy is
     * applied first and the caller's OWN `blankFurniture` still runs over the
     * result. That keeps the reader's injected organ authoritative — a caller
     * that never asked for blanking never gets it, whatever the chunker was
     * told — and it means the page copy can only ever ADD to what this reader
     * already blanked, never replace its judgement with a stranger's
     * parameters.
     *
     * COORDINATE SPACES, AND THE BUG THIS GUARD EXISTS FOR. `splitSentences`
     * normalises newlines (`\r\n` -> `\n`, LENGTH-CHANGING), so
     * `sentence.offset` addresses a NORMALISED copy of the passage, while
     * `chunk.blanked` is aligned to the RAW `chunk.text`. On CRLF material —
     * Gutenberg, anything Windows-authored — the two diverge by one character
     * per preceding CRLF pair, and a length-only check cannot see it: a
     * shifted window has exactly the right length. Measured: three of four
     * sentences corrupted on a CRLF document carrying NO furniture at all,
     * the shifted text beginning mid-word and still shipping the clean
     * address of the sentence it was supposed to be.
     *
     * So the offset is converted through the material's own newline map when
     * the caller injects `normaliseNewlines` (the engine's own organ, whose
     * `toRaw` exists for exactly this), and EVERY candidate is verified
     * per-character before use: it is usable only if each position is either
     * the sentence's own character or a space. Absent the organ, or on any
     * residual disagreement, the check fails and this falls back to the
     * sentence's own text — feature off, never wrong.
     *
     * ORDER. The page copy is read first, because it is aligned to the
     * original and pronoun substitution is length-changing ("He" ->
     * "Johnson"). One consequence is deliberate: a pronoun whose characters
     * were blanked as furniture no longer resolves, because
     * `sentenceWithPronouns`'s own staleness guard sees spaces where it
     * recorded a pronoun and refuses that binding rather than corrupting it
     * in — the correct reading, since a pronoun inside a navigation template
     * is not the passage's anaphora.
     *
     * SCOPE, STATED BECAUSE THE HEADLINE NUMBER READS WIDER THAN IT IS.
     * This reaches EXTRACTION only. `indexFor(list)` and the sentences
     * `pronounBindingsFor` reads are both built from the UNBLANKED `p.text`,
     * so a name that occurs only inside furniture still enters the referent
     * index and can still be a pronoun's antecedent — verified: a name
     * appearing solely in navbox rows still resolves as a referent form with
     * page blanking on, while its edges are gone. What the change removes is
     * navbox EDGES, not navbox REFERENTS. Blanking the index's input too is a
     * separate decision with its own cost (a name genuinely introduced in a
     * caption or a list is then unknown to the reading) and is not taken here.
     *
     * NOTHING HERE RE-SPLITS ANYTHING, so the drift the per-sentence
     * discipline exists to prevent (`blank-furniture-sentence-drift`) is
     * prevented exactly as before: the segmentation is computed once off the
     * untouched bytes and a rewrite is only ever applied WITHIN one
     * already-fixed sentence's span.

// and retrofitting it through machinery built for the other shape is
// real, scoped, unattempted future work, disclosed here rather than
// silently implied. What IS shared, and is the actual point: the
// arrangement's earned names. Every edge below carries `end1`/`label`/
// `end2` — nothing here ever populates `subject`/`verb`/`object`,
// because Latin's oblique cases have no honest 1:1 mapping onto English
// argument structure (this reader's own `end1Detail`/`end2Detail` carry
// the grammatical case instead — a fact English's positional reader has
// no use for and never needed).
