// eoreader6 · perceiver/text/surfaces — candidate referent surfaces, and the
// structural (engine-tier) coreference between them. No word sets anywhere:
// every filter here is derived from the text's own statistics.
//
// THE WHEEL (native/docs/THE-WHEEL.md): this is where the BEINGS are born —
// the spokes, particulars admitted at first admission (S80: an address is a
// birth, not a spelling). A referent is the fold at a point.
//
// SCOPE (Constitution II.13, script earning test): diaNorm below folds only
// the five Latin vowels' acute/grave/circumflex/umlaut diacritics (á/à/â/ä
// ... ú/ù/û/ü). It is disclosed-narrow, not script-agnostic: it does NOT
// fold ñ/ç/ø/å/æ/ß/š/ž/ł or any non-Latin-vowel diacritic, and it does not
// touch combining marks in scripts where they carry phonemic/grammatical
// content rather than accent decoration (Vietnamese tone marks, Hebrew
// niqqud, Arabic tashkil, Devanagari matras) — a blanket Unicode
// combining-mark strip was tried and reverted for exactly this reason: it
// silently claimed cross-script generality with no invariance fixture to
// back it, which II.13 names as the more severe failure than a disclosed
// narrow scope ("the silence is the more severe failure than the scope").
// Extending coverage requires a giver (II.2) for each script's own folding
// rule and a fixture proving it, not an algorithmic generalization.
//
// TIER DISCIPLINE — the load-bearing part, and the reason this file is small:
//   ENGINE tier (derivable, built here): NAME-variant coreference.
//     "Victor Frankenstein" ≈ "Frankenstein" ≈ "Victor" by containment or
//     shared final token. Structural, no witness needed.
//   MODEL tier (NOT derivable, reported as a typed gap): descriptor synonymy
//     ("the creature" ≈ "the wretch") and PRONOUN binding ("he" -> whom).
//     eoreader5's dead-ends log records distributional coref failing twice
//     (frame-level lift, sentence-level complementary distribution). It is not
//     retried here. A missing prior produces a gap, never a guessed number.
//
// Ported rather than reinvented (CLAUDE.md names each of these a
// consistently-reinvented wheel): diaNorm, namesCorefer, the cap/lower
// physics filter, and whole-word counting all come from eoreader5's
// presence.js / entity-fold.js.

 *   `fold`     — a per-token normalizer applied BEFORE comparison (a

 *                transform; null degrades tokenEq to ===).
 *
 * Third argument: an options object `{ sameStem, fold, witness }`, or —
 * for the callers that predate the merge — a bare function, read as `fold`.
 *
 * T5 (eoreader7 task list, 2026-09-10): a shared final token USED to fold
 * unconditionally, no witness required. Crime and Punishment's own
 * "Katerina Ivanovna" / "Alyona Ivanovna" — two different women sharing a
 * patronymic and nothing else — is exactly the shape that produces (the-
 * fold compliance pass 2026-09-07, S38: two unrelated beings collapsed by
 * this fold alone). Containment is left as-is: one string actually
 * containing every token of the other IS real structural evidence (S80,
 * "an address is a birth, not a spelling" — the shorter form's tokens are
 * a subset the longer form witnesses). A shared final token with NO
 * containment either way is weaker — a family name/patronymic worn by
 * more than one person is the ordinary case, not the exception, in any
 * text with a family in it — so it now REQUIRES an injected witness
 * (a caller-supplied confirmation from evidence outside bare string
 * structure, e.g. text/identity-evidence.js's apposition/copula support).
 * Absent a witness it refuses, same posture as `sameStem`/`fold` absent:
 * the capability does not fire rather than guessing. No caller in this
 * checkout supplies one yet — this is a real tightening, not a no-op; run
 * the regression suite and record what stops merging.

// UNCONDITIONAL edit-distance-1 matching is NOT safe on its own, though, and
// this is measured, not assumed: espeak-ng confirms "Reed"/"Reid" and
// "Allen"/"Allan" are each edit-distance-1 AND exact homophones — real,
// common, genuinely DIFFERENT surnames that a bare typo-tolerant fold would
// silently merge. Neither spelling similarity nor pronunciation similarity
// is a safe unconditional identity signal; record-linkage systems never use
// name similarity alone for exactly this reason. So this organ is exported
// as a comparator only — osaDistanceAtMost1/isNearMissSpelling never decide
// identity by themselves. The caller (cast.js::resolve) is what makes this
// safe: near-miss matching only ever runs as a FALLBACK once every other
// resolution has found nothing, and is REFUSED outright the moment it would
// merge a candidate with more than one distinct already-established
// referent — the same "a tie is refused, never guessed" discipline this
// codebase already applies everywhere else (void-brief.js's extentFor,
// succession.js's buildDirectAnchors).

// simplified Damerau-Levenshtein that counts one adjacent transposition as a
// single edit, since a swapped adjacent pair is the single most common
// keyboard/OCR slip) — reported only as a boolean at the bound this organ
// needs, never the exact larger distance. MIN_VARIANT_LEN reuses cast.js's

// WHETHER THIS MECHANISM CAN FIRE ON THIS MATERIAL AT ALL.
//
// Every filter above reads ONE glyph-level property: capitalisation.
// CAP_TOKEN/LOWER_TOKEN, the sentence-initial exclusion, the all-caps
// typography rules, and capitalisationIsSignificant's binomial are all
// questions about case. On a script that HAS no case, none of them can
// fire — not "fires weakly", not "degrades": the mechanism is structurally
// inert, and every count it returns is about whatever cased debris (a Latin
// citation, an English caption) happens to sit in the file, never about the
// material's own language.
//
// Measured, on real material, before this existed: a Hebrew Wikipedia
// article yielded 6 candidate surfaces across 79 sentences and a Korean one
// 15 across 129 — and the surfaces were "Internet Encyclopedia", "The School
// of Athens", and a first-letter-eaten "enny Teichmann" (from "Jenny"). Each
// read as a small, plausible, wholly false result. Nothing said the organ had
// not read the language.
//
// THIS DOES NOT MAKE THOSE SCRIPTS READABLE, and deliberately so. This
// file's own header records that a blanket algorithmic generalisation across
// scripts was tried and REVERTED, because II.13 holds a silent claim of
// cross-script generality to be a more severe failure than a disclosed narrow
// scope. Inventing a caseless substitute for capitalisation here — recurrence,
// n-gram salience, position — would be that same reverted move under a new
// name, and it would need a giver and an invariance fixture per script to be
// admissible at all. So this reports the boundary instead of crossing it,
// which is what the tier discipline above already requires of every other
// undecidable question in this file: A MISSING PRIOR PRODUCES A GAP, NEVER A
// GUESSED NUMBER.
//
// The giver for the distinction itself is the Unicode Character Database's
// own General_Category: `\p{Cased_Letter}` is exactly the set of letters that
// HAVE case (Lu/Ll/Lt), and `\p{L}` minus that is exactly the caseless
// letters (Lo) — Hebrew, Arabic, Hangul, CJK, Devanagari, Thai. Verified
// directly against real strings in Greek, Cyrillic and Armenian (which ARE
// bicameral IN PRACTICE, and are correctly not gapped). Not a list of
// scripts maintained here; a property looked up per character.
//
// Georgian was ALSO claimed correctly-not-gapped here, on the same test, and
// that claim was wrong — found running this instrument on all 516 real UDHR
// translations (live_priors POLICIES.md LP13 (was LP8)), not by re-reading this file.
// `\p{Cased_Letter}` answers "does this LETTER belong to a case category" —
// Mkhedruli, modern Georgian's everyday alphabet, is General_Category Ll, so
// it passes. It does not answer the question this mechanism actually needs
// answered: does the MATERIAL ever use the OTHER member of that category —
// Mtavruli, Georgian's uppercase — to mark anything. Ordinary published
// Georgian does not; Mtavruli is a monumental/decorative variant, not a
// working capitalisation convention, and a real 10,174-letter UDHR
// translation contained exactly zero of it (its only Lu characters were 30
// stray Latin letters from the file's own English header). `scriptCoverage`
// read that as casedShare 1.0 and gap: null; extractSurfaces, run on the
// same real material, found zero real Georgian surfaces — every one of the
// 18 "candidates" it did find was that same Latin debris. This is caught
// below by a third, distinct boundary; the two boundaries above are
// unchanged and still correct for what they test.

/**
 * How much of this material's own writing the capitalisation mechanism can

 * Returns `{ casedLetters, caselessLetters, casedShare, gap }`. `gap` is null
 * when the material is bicameral enough for the mechanism to be about it, and
 * otherwise a typed gap carrying the measured share, so a caller can never
 * read a surface count without also being told what fraction of the script it
 * was computed over.
 *
 * Three boundaries, all structural, none a dial:
 *   - `casedLetters === 0` with letters present: the mechanism cannot fire at
 *     all. Zero is not a threshold.
 *   - caseless letters in the MAJORITY: most of this material is invisible to
 *     the mechanism. Majority is where a plurality flips — the same non-tuned
 *     standing this project's writer-decay window already declares for itself
 *     — not a chosen constant.
 *   - the material's letters are all cased AND pass both checks above, yet no
 *     CAPITALISATION ever appears where this mechanism can read it as
 *     evidence (Georgian's Mkhedruli, found live — see the header above).
 *     `CAP_TOKEN` deliberately excludes sentence-initial position (position
 *     is not namehood); a material where the case member THIS mechanism
 *     watches for never once occurs elsewhere is exactly as blind as one
 *     with no case category at all, whatever Unicode's own General_Category
 *     says about its letters. Tested not by a percentage but by the same
 *     recurrence the extraction mechanism itself already computes: does ANY
 *     candidate surface — `accumulateSurfaceEvidence`'s own `sentenceIndex`,
 *     reused rather than re-derived — appear in more than zero sentences.
 *     Zero is not a threshold here either.
 *
 * @param {object} [options.evidence] a `createSurfaceEvidence()` accumulator
 *   already folded over `sentences` via `accumulateSurfaceEvidence` — reused
 *   so a caller who is about to call `extractSurfaces` on the same sentences
 *   anyway (eot-sidecar.mjs's `attemptWindow` does exactly this) folds the
 *   material once, not twice. Omit it and this computes its own — the third
 *   boundary needs the SAME walk `extractSurfaces` performs to ask its
 *   question, and a second implementation of that walk here would be
 *   exactly the drift class this codebase's own postmortems (P22, P24, P25
 *   in the-fold's CLAUDE.md) already name.

/**
 * The same Unicode Cased_Letter/L distinction `scriptCoverage` folds across
 * a whole document, computed PER SENTENCE instead. `scriptCoverage` answers
 * "can the capitalisation mechanism see this document at all" — one verdict
 * for the whole file. A document that MIXES scripts (a bilingual specimen;
 * a caption or pull-quote in another script than the surrounding prose)
 * needs the finer question answered per segment: WHICH sentences are even
 * written in a script this mechanism can read. Built for that case — see
 * `native/READING-SPEC.md` S92 — rather than adding a second, parallel
 * script-detection mechanism (this file's own header already names that
 * anti-pattern and reverted it once, II.13).
 *
 * Returns one entry per input sentence, in the SAME order:
 *   { order, casedLetters, caselessLetters, casedShare, dominant }
 * `dominant` is `"cased"` (a script `extractSurfaces` can read — e.g. Latin,
 * Greek, Cyrillic), `"caseless"` (one it structurally cannot — e.g. Han,
 * Hebrew, Devanagari; see `script_without_case` above), `"mixed"` when
 * neither reaches a majority within that one sentence, or `null` when the
 * sentence has no letters at all (so nothing is coerced into a bucket it
 * was never evidence for).
 *
 * SCOPE, stated as plainly as this file's other boundaries: this is a
 * per-character Unicode General_Category test, the same one `scriptCoverage`
 * already uses — it is script identification (Latin vs. Han vs. …), not
 * language identification. A Latin-script loanword or proper noun sitting
 * inside an otherwise-Han sentence still counts toward that sentence's
 * `casedLetters`, same as it would inside `scriptCoverage`'s whole-document
 * tally; this function does not, and cannot, tell "this is English" apart
 * from "this is French written in the Latin alphabet." For the concrete
 * case this was built for — a document whose sentences are EITHER English
 * (Latin, cased) OR Mandarin (Han, caseless), never a third script — that
 * distinction is exactly the one `dominant` needs to draw, and no further
 * claim is made past it.

 *   is measured against — the fence keeps falling as more documents join,
 *   until it wrongly brands an ordinary name individuating-token as generic
 *   PURELY because other, unrelated documents were also in the batch.
 *   Measured live on the challenge-25 fixture: "kade" (correctly generic
 *   within source A alone, by A's own co-occurrence structure — it is A's
 *   title, not A's individuating evidence) additionally took "marcus" and
 *   "aurelius" down with it the moment source C's candidates joined the
 *   pool, because C's own one-off proper nouns (unrelated to Kade) pushed
 *   the POOLED fence to 1 — collapsing a within-document merge
 *   ("Marcus Aurelius" / "Marcus Aurelius Kade") that succeeds standalone.
 *   `groups`, when given, derives the generic set PER GROUP and unions the
 *   results — each document's own candidates are still judged against
 *   their OWN co-occurrence breadth, exactly as the single-document case
 *   already does; pooling more documents can only ADD generic tokens found
 *   within some document's own material, never dilute another document's
 *   fence with material foreign to it.
 *
 *   `deriveMinSentences`'s recurrence floor has the EXACT same compositional
 *   flaw and gets the same treatment: pooled flat, a richly-recurring
 *   document (many candidates recurring across many sentences) raises the
 *   25th-percentile floor past what a SHORT, sparser document's own
 *   candidates can ever clear — a name that individuates fine standalone
 *   drops out entirely the moment it is pooled with a longer document,
 *   never merging (there's no DEF.admit event to merge) rather than
 *   over-merging. `groups` derives the floor per group too, so each
 *   document's own candidates are judged against their own recurrence
 *   floor, exactly as `minSentences` already promises for the
 *   single-document case.

  //     first and left the other stranded in its own referent. A greedy
  //     first-match closure over the pairwise rule is not transitive, and
  //     "is the same being as" necessarily is.
  //   · ACCRETION. With bare "Mikhail" assigned FIRST and two real bearers
  //     in the material ("Mikhail Kutuzov", "Mikhail Barclay") each compound
  //     matched the bare fragment and both landed in ONE referent — two
  //     generals merged through a shared first name sitting at (not above)
  //     the generic fence.
  //
  // Both die to the same two rules, and the direction of containment is the
  // whole difference between them (S9 — high sets probability for low: a
  // group's ESTABLISHED evidence decides what may join it, never its
  // weakest member):
  //
  //   1. Membership is decided against the group's MAXIMAL member — the
  //      surface carrying the most individuating tokens — never against any
  //      member. A fragment cannot pull in a third party the group's own
  //      evidence refuses ("Mikhail Barclay" vs a group whose maximal is
  //      "Mikhail Kutuzov" is refused, whatever bare members the group holds).
  //   2. A surface matching MULTIPLE groups merges them only when it
  //      WITNESSES the merge — its own individuating tokens CONTAIN each
  //      group's maximal evidence ("Mikhail Kutuzov" ⊇ {mikhail}, ⊇
  //      {kutuzov}: one person, stated by the material in one breath). A
  //      surface on the SUBSET side of multiple groups (bare "Mikhail"
  //      against established "Mikhail Kutuzov" and "Mikhail Barclay") is an
  //      ambiguous fragment claiming membership in both, and strands as its
  //      own referent — disclosed on its event, never guessed.
  //
  // The generic fence remains the outer guard (three-plus bearers make the
  // shared token generic and it stops individuating at all); these rules
  // close the two-bearer band the fence's own strict-exceeds convention
  // deliberately leaves open.
  // A THIRD SHAPE, found 2026-09-05 by the same battery re-run, and the
  // blind spot the two rules above share: the ANCHOR ARRIVES FIRST. Assignment
  // is most-individuated-first (below), so a group's maximal member is
  // usually its founder, and every fragment then faces THAT member alone,
  // one at a time. Two different fragments of one anchor — "Oxford
  // University" and "University Press" against "Oxford University Press",
  // the Translations bibliography that also lists Cambridge and Cornell
  // University Press — each pass rule 1 on their own (each is a subset of
  // the maximal's tokens) and both are absorbed, though they never match
  // EACH OTHER: {oxford, university} and {university, press} overlap on one
  // token and neither contains the other. Rule 2 cannot see it: there is
  // only ever one group in play, never two to bridge. The greedy closure is
  // still not transitive, just through the anchor now instead of a bare
  // fragment.
  //
  // The cut is exactly the shape and nothing wider: a fragment arriving
  // into a single matched group is held against that group's OTHER
